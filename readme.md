# StarboundCannery
## Description
Adds the ability to can certain foods for long-term preservation. Food with effects retains the same effects. Cans stack to 10.

Empty cans can be made in lots of 10 per Iron bar at the farming/agriculture station or can be purchased at Terramart for 4 pixels each. Empty cans stack to 100.

Canning recipes are currently added to the cooking station with the possibility of custom canning station to be added later. Recipes for canned produce are learned upon first craft of an empty can and canned meals are learned upon crafting the uncanned version of the item.

Canned produce such as tomatoes, corn, pearlpeas etc. require more than 1 to make a can. The amount of raw produce needed to make a can is worked out by how much raw produce would be needed to be consumed to restore at minimum 10 hunger. So canned corn which requires 3 corn restores 11.25 hunger which is 3 x 3.75.
